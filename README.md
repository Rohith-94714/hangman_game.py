Project Description

This repository contains a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret word one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the complete word.

Rules:

> You have a limited number of attempts (7) to guess the word correctly.

> Each incorrect guess will count against your total attempts.

> Duplicate letter guesses will not be penalized, but the correct letter's positions will be revealed.

> Non-letter characters and empty inputs are not allowed. Only single letters are valid guesses.
